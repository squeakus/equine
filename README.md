equine
======

My first attempt at an evolutionary quine. Why would I do such a thing? Nobody knows.....


The equine is being applied to the onemax problem. It has a binary genome and will keep changing its genome until it gets all ones, i.e., [1,1,1,1,1,1]

It is not really evolutionary (yet!), it will reinitialise its DNA until it gets the right answer.

when you run equine.py it generates out.py. This is so it doesn't overwrite the source code (I felt really stupid when it did that). execute out.py and it will keep running until it gets the right answer.
